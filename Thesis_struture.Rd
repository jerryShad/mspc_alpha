# MSPC Package - Bioconductor Package for Multiple Sample Peak Calling

Title : Development of Bioconductor Package for Multiple Sample Peak Calling
 
Thesis workflow:
  1. goal of R package:
   - from the bioconductor software quality, make sure to use suitable data objects and method
   - regarding the result, output must same with Musera tools
  
  2. Thesis structure:
   step.1 : what is the difference MSPC and regular peak calling (explian and motivate answer)
   step.2 : what is the difference between R and Bioconductor software
   step.3 : motivate my original approach and its limit, and why I follow my strategy to implement the method with novel implementation
   step.4 : describe my implementation
   step.5 : provide comparison with existing software tools, is there any difference? Any good work done compare to others? Think about more
   step.6 : Review all content and ready to defend
   step.7 : congrats, I made it, I excell myself finally !!!
